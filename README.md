# Financial Analytics with Python

### Credit Risk Modelling on the Loan Dataset
```The dataset has four features namely default(our target feature), student, balance and income. An extensive EDA was performed and financial insights were derived. Modelling was done implementing Logistic Regression after balancing the dataset using SMOTE(Imblearn Oversampler). Performance metrices like Confusion matrix, classification report were considerd for validating the model. Dataset used- "Default.csv"```

### Simple Portfolio using Python
```The Goal was creating a sample portfolio and finding out portfolio simple returns, get daily returns, volatility, etc. The data was extracted from Yahoo Finance using Pandas Data Reader. Stocks for "FB", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOG" were considered. Data used- Yahoo Finance with Pandas Datareader for extracting FAANG stock prices. NOTE: I took 2013-01-01 as the starting date because Facebook did not have an Initial Public Offering (IPL) prior mid 2012.```

### ETH Price Prediction using SVR
```A simple Support Vector Machine Regressor was implemented for predicting the next 5 days price of Ethereum based on historical data. Actual price vs Predicted price was then compared and plotted. Data was gathered from Yahoo Finance from 01/01/2021 till 08/09/2021.(ETH-USD.csv)```
